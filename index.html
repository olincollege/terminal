    <h2>🕯️ How it all began...</h2>
    <p>With a thump on my doorstep in the middle of the night.</p>
    <p>My sister died, twenty years ago. And now, twenty years later, I've just received a package in the mail. It was a ratty old thing, large and clunky, taped together with a peeling, browning adhesive that I was willing to bet was about as old as me. It crumpled at my touch-almost like it had been waiting for me.</p> 
    <p>Inside was something even stranger: squat and square, with a dim, six-by-eight inch pixelated screen-it was her computer. Her final message. Her last act. You see, she wasn’t just my sister—she was a government cybersecurity specialist for the FBI. And her death? Never quite made sense to me.</p>
    <p><strong>This is my investigation.</strong></p>

    <h2>🎥 Watch Terminal Come to Life</h2>
    <p>The machine hums. The screen flickers. Somewhere in the code, her voice lingers.</p>
    <p>This demo walks through the first steps of the investigation — navigating her encrypted directories, decoding old journal entries, and breaking past the first firewall.</p>
