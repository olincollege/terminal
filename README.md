# terminal: the game

Twenty years ago, my sister — the only person in the world who loved me without reservations — died. They said it was an accident. They said it was over.

They lied.

I was just a kid when it happened. I didn’t know what she was working on. I didn’t understand the late-night calls, the encrypted drives, the sudden silence without any warnings. But I always knew something was wrong.

Now, two decades later, a package arrives. No return address. No explanation. Just her old laptop — battered, encrypted, and practically humming with secrets that were never meant to be unearthed.

This game is not just a puzzle.

It is a reconstruction. A resurrection. A final message stitched into code by a woman who knew they were coming for her — and who knew that, one day, I would come in search for the truth.

This is my investigation.

This is *terminal*.
