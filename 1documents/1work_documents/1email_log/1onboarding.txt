Subject: Welcome!

Dear Alice,

I wish to extend you a warm welcome to this job. I understand that the primary job description being tightly under wraps has given you some anxiety, and as your soon-to-be supervisor, I wish to alleviate some of your worries — from all that I have heard of you, from your resume to your interview transcript, I am confident that you are more than prepared to take on this job. 

You will soon receive the following onboarding emails, all of which are necessary for you to read through and detail, and I ask that you respond ASAP. 
Offer letter and basic job information
Contracts, W-9, and NDA forms 
Credentials 
Trainings

From one government official to another, I am required to emphasize the need for secrecy in this job to you. No one, not your closest friends or even your family members, are allowed to know of even the smallest whisper of what we encounter here. But from one coworker, and one friend to another, I’m sure you’re already aware of that. ;) 

I have heard from the grapevine that I’m to wish your sister a happy birthday! I hope your family has a good celebration. 

Sincerely,
Rob Carter 
Supervisor

Dear Rob,

Thank you for your warm welcome, and for this helpful email! I’m sure I’ll be referencing it a lot in the coming days. And I really appreciate you taking the time to assuage some of my worries! 

I would ask how you knew about my sister, but I suppose that’s the FBI for you! LOL 

Looking forward to working with you!
Alice

Subject: Onboarding Complete!

Hi Rob,

Just wanted to let you know that I’ve finished going through all the onboarding materials — trainings, forms, Protocol 9 (which was... certainly something), and everything in between. I think I'm all set to hit the ground running!

That said, I have to admit, a few parts of the process definitely left me raising an eyebrow. Nothing I can't handle, of course — just wondering if that’s par for the course around here? :)

Looking forward to diving in more soon. Let me know if there’s anything else I should be doing in the meantime!

Best,
Alice

Hi Alice,

Glad to hear you made it through onboarding in one piece! And yes — Protocol 9 does tend to raise a few eyebrows. Let’s just say you’re officially initiated now. ;)

You handled it all like a pro, which is exactly what I expected. A little strangeness here and there just comes with the FBI territory. You get used to it… or you learn not to ask too many questions. (Kidding! Mostly.)

Nothing else for you to do right now — just rest up, stay curious, and be ready. We’ll hit the ground running soon enough.

Welcome to the team — for real this time.

Cheers,
Rob
