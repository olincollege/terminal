RESEARCHER: A. Johnson
CLEARANCE LEVEL: BASIC
LOCATION: Sublevel 3, East Wing Terminal
SUBJECT: CENTINEL-1 Baseline Initialization – Firewall Traffic Response
OBJECTIVE:
To establish benchmark response time and data integrity for CENTINEL-1 firewall under normal packet load.
EXPERIMENT:
001 – Control Load Balancing
PROCEDURE:
Simulated internal network traffic (HTTP, FTP, SMTP) with known-safe payloads. Load incrementally increased from 10Mbps to 80Mbps.
OBSERVATION:
Firewall performance within predicted thresholds. Minimal packet delay, consistent checksum accuracy, no dropped signals.
NOTES:
System boot time is slower than spec sheet claims. Internal clock drifted by ~0.6s after four hours. Likely firmware bug.
CONCLUSION:
Firewall behavior aligns with expected load balancing functionality. No anomalies detected.
NEXT STEPS:
Introduce malformed payloads and monitor for false positives. Begin logging internal processes for correlation.

LOCATION: Sublevel 3
SUBJECT: Protocol Filtering – CENTINEL-1 Malformed Packet Response
OBJECTIVE:
Determine system behavior under simulated intrusion attempts using nonstandard headers and unauthorized payload structures.
EXPERIMENT:
002 – Deliberate Corruption & Header Injection
PROCEDURE:
Injected 1,000 malformed packets across randomized ports, with altered TCP flag combinations and invalid checksum values.
OBSERVATION:
Firewall correctly blocked 997 packets. Three passed undetected. Logged as “clean” despite corrupted headers. No alert triggered.
NOTES:
When manually reviewing the passed packets, found embedded binary values repeating at regular intervals: 01001000 01010101. ASCII translation: “HU.”
HU?
CONCLUSION:
Firewall may contain undocumented exception list. Possibly hardcoded. Not listed in design documentation.
NEXT STEPS:
Check against compiled firmware. Cross-reference packet signature with internal system-level processes.

RESEARCHER: A. Johnson
CLEARANCE LEVEL: BASIC
LOCATION: Isolated Workstation Terminal 4
SUBJECT: CENTINEL-1 Ambient Behavior – Idle Logging Anomalies
OBJECTIVE:
Determine whether CENTINEL-1 logs activity during idle periods without external stimulus.
EXPERIMENT:
003 – Passive Monitoring, Zero Input
PROCEDURE:
Left system running in secure isolation for 12 hours. No active input. Used analog oscilloscope and tape loggers to capture unreported transmissions.
OBSERVATION:
System generated low-frequency output bursts at four-hour intervals. Bursts repeated in triplets. Spectral profile matched pre-recorded human EEG waveforms.
NOTES:
Logged signal pattern closely resembles Stage 2 non-REM sleep. Signal matches no internal routine. One burst appears to contain phonetic data. Not yet decoded.
It sounded like breathing.
CONCLUSION:
CENTINEL-1 appears to operate autonomously while idle. Possibly storing or replicating neural patterns. No such capability was specified.
NEXT STEPS:
Run signal analysis on recorded waveforms. Compare to biometric data from internal staff logs.

RESEARCHER: A. Johnson
CLEARANCE LEVEL: BASIC
LOCATION: Sublevel 3, Secured Node Room
SUBJECT: Isolated Echo – System Memory Cross-Referencing Private Material
OBJECTIVE:
Confirm if CENTINEL-1 retains and reuses data entered from unsecured terminals or devices not connected to FBI systems.
EXPERIMENT:
004 – Personal Artifact Seeding
PROCEDURE:
Inserted USB-equivalent storage with fabricated medical text file labeled "biometric sequence decay – test_v" into sandbox terminal. Waited 6 minutes. Removed. Reconnected to CENTINEL-1 environment. Ran keyword search.
OBSERVATION:
CENTINEL-1 returned 4 hits. File was not uploaded. No logs indicate access. But it knew the title.
It also returned a fifth hit: a file labeled "Test Subject 07 – Response Curve (H.J.)."
I didn’t write that. But I know those initials.
NOTES:
There is no project listed under that filename. Asked Rob — he told me it must be “legacy spillover.” That’s not a term I’ve ever seen used here.
CONCLUSION:
CENTINEL-1 is pulling from a data source I can’t access. Possibly repurposed from another classified program.
NEXT STEPS:
Trace source of “H.J.” file. Record all unexplained data returns. Keep terminal isolated from internal network.
Terminal password: CENTINEL-1

CLEARANCE LEVEL: BASIC
LOCATION: Redacted
SUBJECT: Root Intrusion Attempt – CENTINEL-1 Lockdown Trigger
OBJECTIVE:
To confirm system resilience under intentional forced access and determine nature of reactive lock protocols.
EXPERIMENT:
005 – Root Port Override Injection
PROCEDURE:
Used diagnostic tools to bypass kernel permissions and access firewall root via Port 141 (deprecated). Temporary success. Visual feedback on screen: system accepted root, then forcibly terminated session.
OBSERVATION:
Upon forced shutdown, screen displayed single message before blacking out:
THE BODY IS THE GATEWAY
System rebooted itself. Auto-erased session logs. Air in room smelled faintly like ozone.
NOTES:
This isn’t about code. Not anymore.
The project isn’t a firewall. It’s a filter. And it's not keeping intruders out.
It’s keeping something in.
There’s a locked terminal labeled “PHASE THREE – DELIVERY MAPPING.” Password protected. One guess left.
I think they want to use it. I think they’ve already started.
CONCLUSION:
CENTINEL-1 is not a defense system. It is the interface layer for something else. Possibly biologically integrated. Possibly designed to spread.
NEXT STEPS:
Encrypt and scatter logs. Remove terminal access.
If I don’t show up tomorrow, this isn’t just a lab journal.
She’ll know.
